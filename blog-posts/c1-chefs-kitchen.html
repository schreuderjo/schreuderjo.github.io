      <h2>Thoughts on DBC Culture 8/10/14</h2>
      <p>I think that the Fireside chat with Shereef was actually something that I needed to hear tonight.  I am already somewhat familiar with the DBC mindset from talking to a friend who happens to be a DBC Alum, but it's always good to be reminded.  As someone who comes from a competitive background in collegiate athletics, its difficult for me not to compare myself to other people.  I frequently have to monitor my thinking and reflect back on how far I have come in my own learning in order to deal with the frustration that comes with learning development.</p>
      <p>I am definitely nervous about the program, especially after the challenges that I have faced in phase-0-week-1 alone, and I know that I will have to work harder than I have in my life and that I will have to put on a chef's apron and get messy to borrow the metaphor.  I think the biggest challenge will be engineering the mindset that has been bred into me by my own education.  As a former educator, a lot of what Shereef said about education culture in this country resonated with me. I often felt as a teacher that my students would have benefited more from a curious mindset than anything I could ever tell them.  In fact, I would frequently tell them they could learn more in the books the read than I could ever hope to tell them in an hour a day.</p>
      <p>I have felt like from the beginning that despite my reservations about my not being good enough or smart enough to do this, that I would be a good fit for DBC.  I like the team-based approach and the focus on growth and soft skills that I think are so underrated in the work-place.  I also feel like the program is exactly what I was looking for.  The idea of being able to jump in and take ownership of DBC and make the most of my own learning is really appealing at the same time that its daunting.  I'm really looking forward to getting into that space and working with the people there.</p>
