      <h2>Pairing is Caring</h2>
      <p>Pairing sessions are a central part of the DBC culture.  With my experience in Phase 0 so far, I am beginning to understand why.</p>
      <p>The first couple weeks I really struggled with the feeling of being overwhelmed and often frustrated.  I frequently internalized this struggle instead of reaching out for help and asking for pairing sessions.  However, after getting a feel for pairing after the first few sessions, I started to realize that I was not the only one who faced challenges coding.</p>
      <p>One of the best things about pairing is that you realize that your struggles are not really just your own; that others face similar fears and frustrations.  Additionally, it can be really rewarding when you and your pair have been stuck on a challenge for a while and you finally break through and get it to pass.</p>
      <p>Of course, pairing can also be difficult at times.  I find myself internalizing when my pair and I run into an issue and we can't seem to get around it.  I find these thoughts running through my head like: "Why haven't I figured this out yet?" or "Why hasn't my pair come up with something yet?"</p>
      <p>The best pairing sessions come from good communication, patience, and flexibility, but sometimes one of these three things will start to crumble and it can change the feel of a session.  I've had one session so far where I felt like my pair wanted to control the session and drove the whole time.  It was frustrating because I felt like an inconvenience or that I was not trusted enough to take the helm.  I really felt myself shutting down, but I was too shy to say something.  I know going forward that part of this was my fault as well, because I could have communicated how I was feeling better.  I have no doubt that should I have mentioned it my pair and I would have been able to work through it better.<p>
      <h3>The Power of Feedback</h3>
      <p>Part of what makes pairing useful is that not only do you pick up tips and tricks from almost every person you pair with, but through feedback you get a good sense of where you are as a pair, and what you need to improve on.</p>
      <p>The key to writing good feedback is to make it specific enough to pinpoint exactly what area your pair is doing well in or needs to improve on, giving them something that they actually <em>can</em> improve on, and doing it in a no bullshit but direct way. This is perhaps the hardest part. I find it easy to point out things that my pair did well, but it seems to be harder to suggest areas of improvment.</p>
      <p>The first couple times I gave feedback I was not sure what to say when it came to offering up suggestions for improvement, but after a while I realized that the most helpful feedback for me was when I was left with something tangible going forward.  Since then I have always tried to think of at least one thing that could be helpful for my pair to work on.</p>
      <p>It can be strangely unnerving to read what other people think about you as a pair, but I often find that the feedback is better than what I would have given myself.  Actually, so far I have been disappointed that more people don't give me something to improve on.  I know I am not perfect, and far too often people cop out of the 2nd part of feedback and just sing praises.</p>
      <p>Part of what makes it difficult is that often my pair and I are on similar levels with technical ability.  I find it's often better for me to focus on something about pairing that they could be doing better.  I've also found that its best to fill out feedback forms relatively soon after the session when things are fresh.  I have made the mistake of waiting a couple days before and then not really known what I wanted to say.</p>
      <p>Overall, when used properly pairing and feedback can be a powerful learning tool coding.  More importantly though, pairing helps developers grow culturally to reach their potential as team players.</p>
