        <h3>My Reflection<h3>
        <p>This challenge was a nice balance between challenging and do able. My pair and I spent two hours on the whole challenge but different parts took longer than others.  It was easy enough to change pixels to percentages, but we had a harder time changing the display of the nav bar to above the content of the page.  This was largely due to a combined ingnorance on both our parts as to how block, inline, and inline block displays work.  We messed around with this part for a long time to get it to work.
        </p>
        <p>The next couple tasks were similarly pretty straightforward but we really got stuck trying to adjust the font size to respond to changes in screen width.  We tried a few things with em and with percentages but realized that these only set fonts relative to a parent font and not relative to the screensize.  After a lot of digging and playing around with code my pair discover something called viewport width which will convert the font size to a percentage of the screenwidth.  This can also be used for screen height.  Of course, before we tried this we actually experimented with media queries but realized that was kind of choppy and not as ideal as something that responds to changing screensizes.
        </p>
        I'm pretty confident in my understanding of pixels and percentages but I still struggle with positioning and displays in CSS and I need to experiment more with media queries to be more confident in using them.   I understand the theory and big picture behind responsive web design and I think its a really neat idea.  Its something that I guess I always took for granted as a web consumer but its kind of exciting to understand how it works and why it would be useful.
